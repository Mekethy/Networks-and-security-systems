# Network and Systems Security – E-Portfolio

This repository contains my full portfolio for the Network and Systems Security course.  
All portfolio material is organised week by week


| Week | Topic | Folder |
|------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 2 | Public/private key cryptography, key generation | Week2 |
| 3 | Authentication, hashing, salting | Week3 |
| 4 | Intrusion detection, suspicious activity, integrity monitoring | Week4 |
| 5 | Web security | Week5 |
| 6 | Binary Analysis & Symbolic Execution | Week6 |
| 7 | Penetration testing | Week7 |
| 9 | LLM security and risk examples | Week9 |

Week 2 focuses on understanding asymmetric cryptography using RSA key pairs, this helped me understand how public-key systems work in practice.

Week 3 focuses on password security mechanisms such as hashing and salting, this helped me to understand why hashing alone isn't enough. It shows how small improvements such as salting makes large differences when defending against real hackers.

Week 4 focuses on methods of detecting suspicious behaviour, this helps to show how even simple monitoring tools can detect early anomaloes and highlights how integrity checking is the foundation of higher end security tools.

Week 5 focuses on scanning webisites to analyse vulnerabilities within websites, this helps to show how even simple scanning can expose weaknesses within a website and shows how important it is to secure websites properly with correct practices.

Week 6 focuses on analysing logs to identify suspicious behaviour, this shows how valuable keeping logs are in real world security as it can reveal early warning signs of intrusion or misuse.

Week 7 focuses on testing via penetration, this helps to understand how attackers approach a target system along with how passive information can be gathered

Week 9 focuses on large learning models and their security, this helps show how different models can have varying security practices which affect how vulnerable they are to attacks
